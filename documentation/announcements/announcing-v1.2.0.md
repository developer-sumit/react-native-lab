# 🚀 **What's New in v1.2.0 of React Native Lab?** 🎉

Hello React Native devs! 👋

We’re back with some awesome updates in **v1.2.0** to make your development process even more seamless. Let’s dive into the latest features:

---

## 🎣 **Custom Hooks Integration**

Supercharge your projects with a collection of **pre-built hooks**:

- **`useDebounce`**: Wait before executing a function.
- **`useThrottle`**: Limit how often a function can run.
- **`usePrevious`**: Access the previous value of any state or prop.
- **`useOrientation`**: React to device orientation changes.
- **`useResponsiveLayout`**: Get responsive layout info based on screen size.

No more reinventing the wheel—just plug and play!

## 🔇 **ConsoleRemover for Production**

Say goodbye to unwanted console logs in your production builds!

- Removes **all console statements**: `log`, `warn`, `error`, `info`, etc.
- **Boosts security** by ensuring no sensitive logs are exposed.
- **Reduces app size** for faster performance.

Your production builds will now be cleaner, safer, and more efficient.

## 🔐 **Flexible Environment Variable Management**

Manage configurations effortlessly with improved `.env` support:

- Automatically sets up a **`.env` file** for storing sensitive data.
- Choose your preferred library:
  - **`react-native-config`**
  - **`react-native-dotenv`**
- Ensures secure and organized handling of environment variables.

More flexibility, less hassle!
